A toolchain file is provided for cross-compiling this library to an armeabi-v7a platform. See cmake/Toolchain-Android-armeabi-v7a.cmake.

The Android build requires a modified version of libusb available here:

Build libusb-1.0 with an Android NDK toolchain and place the resulting .so and .h files in a convenient location.  See the toolchain file for more detailed instructions.
